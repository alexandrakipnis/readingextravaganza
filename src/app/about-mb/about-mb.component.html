          Mortar Board is a national honor society that recognizes a group of college seniors each year for their outstanding
      leadership, commitment to service, and academic excellence. These three qualities represent the three pillars of Mortar Board.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Purdue University has its own chapter of Mortar Board named after the retired Dean of Students Barbara Cook, who advised 
          Mortar Board from 1956 to 1986.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Service, one of the three pillars, is a large focus for the Barbara Cook Chapter of Mortar Board. Mortar Board's national
        philanthropy of Reading is Leading works to promote literacy across the world for people of all ages.

         With a greater goal of promoting literacy across the world, the Barbara Cook Chapter has focused its efforts within the local Lafayette community to increase childhood literacy.
         In the past, Purdue's Mortar Board chapter has put on an annual event called Reading Extravaganza. This event brought in hundreds of Lafayette elementary school students to Purdue University
         and hosted fun activities, featured Purdue celebrity readers, and more. 

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to social distancing restrictions brought on by COVID-19, the Mortar Board Service team has taken the time to re-imagine the Reading Extravaganza experience into a meaningful virtual one.
            Though we are sad that we cannot hold this event in person this year, we are eager to emmulate the Reading Extravganza experience in a safe, online way. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          One of the most exciting things about a virtual Reading Extravaganza experience is that we can have a much broader reach. Rather than just interacting with one or two schools as we have done in the past,
          we can now extend our literacy reach across all of Indiana!
